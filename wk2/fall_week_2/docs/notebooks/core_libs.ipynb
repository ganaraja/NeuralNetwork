    "\n",
    "1. ***Multidimensional Arrays:*** Efficient storage and manipulation of large numerical datasets, of homogeneous types (e.g., all float32 or int64).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Performance:*** Written in C for low-level speed. Operations are significantly faster than native Python loops, and also supports vectorized operations (SIMD-level performance via broadcasting).\n",
    "(SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data is a type of parallel processing where a single instruction is executed on multiple data points simultaneously.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Scientific Computing:*** Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number capabilities and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Interoperability:*** Widely adopted in libraries like: Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. ***Mature, stable and serves as a backbone for most ML/AI libraries***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No GPU support - use CuPy, JAX\n",

    "1. ***Unrivaled Customization :*** For creating publication-quality figures for academic papers, presentations, or specific branding requirements, Matplotlib's fine-grained control is unmatched. You can tweak absolutely everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Foundation and Compatibility :*** Its position as the underlying engine for many other popular libraries (Seaborn, Pandas plot) means that learning Matplotlib provides a valuable fundamental understanding and ensures compatibility across different plotting tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. ***Versatile Plot Types :*** Matplotlib supports almost every common 2D plot type, including: Line plots, Scatter plots, Bar charts (vertical and horizontal), Histograms, Pie charts, Heatmaps, Contour plots, Basic 3D plotting (mplot3d toolkit)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Few Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Dated Default Aesthetics***: Out-of-the-box, Matplotlib plots can sometimes look a bit dated or less aesthetically pleasing compared to libraries like Seaborn or Plotly, requiring more code for visual appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Verbosity for Simple Plots***: For straightforward plots, the object-oriented API can be a bit verbose, requiring explicit management of figures and axes, whereas higher-level libraries simplify this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Statistical Graphics Simplicity***: While it can create statistical plots, ***Seaborn*** simplifies the creation of complex statistical visualizations with less code and better defaults.\n",
